## project features

Full-stack projects will be evaluated against the following "Minimal Viable Product" features.

- New account creation, login, and guest/demo login
- A production README file for your GitHub repository containing:
  - Brief explanation of what the app is and does
  - Link to live site
  - Discussion of technologies used
  - Discussion of two features that show off the team's technical abilities
  - Discussion of both challenges faced and the way the team solved them
  - Code snippets to highlight the best code
- Hosting on Render.com
- For four features:
  - 2 features must be full CRUD, the other 2 features can be partial CRUD
  - Adequate styling
  - Smooth, bug-free navigation
  - Adequate and appropriate seed data to demonstrate the feature

In order for this to be considered complete, you must have the first three criteria completed. In addition to that, you will also need to have four of your features demonstrating the checklist under item 4. After the following section is a list of required features if you decide to clone one of the sites from the list above.
